location, size, condition, time), these factors can change quite substantially from one property to another\n- The housing market itself is quite a volatile industry, and is quite dependent on demand and supply fluctuations, not to even mention economic factors sch as interest rates & inflation, so its quite a challenge to predict the price variation over time\n- It's also quite challenging to predict housing prices due to the limited data that is available, most datasets contain a limited number of features related to each property, such is why feature engineering is quite important\n- As a result, it is generally quite difficult to accurately predict property prices that take into account all the factors that influence it\n- The California housing dataaset contains different house related attributes for properties located in California\n\n<div style=\"color:white;display:fill;border-radius:8px;font-size:100%; letter-spacing:1.0px;\"><p style=\"padding:

Overcome missing data with a basic **unsupervised learning** data imputation\n- Identification of **outliers** in a dataset\n- Understand how to turn a simple model into your own **sklearn**

For reasons of simplicity, we will use an isotropic Gaussian distribution over parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ with zero mean:\n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\alpha) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{0}, \\alpha^{-1}\\mathbf{I}) \\tag{8}\n$$\n\nAn isotropic Gaussian distribution has a diagonal covariance matrix where all diagonal elements have the same variance $\\alpha^{-1}$ ($\\alpha$ is the precision of the prior). A zero mean favors small(er) values of parameters $w_j$ a priori. The prior is [conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior) to the likelihood $p(\\mathbf{t} \\lvert \\mathbf{w}, \\beta)$ meaning that the posterior distribution has the same functional form as the prior i.e. is also a Gaussian. In this special case, the posterior has an analytical solution with the following sufficient statistics \n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{m}_N &= \\beta \\mathbf{S}_N \\boldsymbol\\Phi^T \\mathbf{t}  \\tag{9} \\\\\n\\mathbf{S}_N^{-1} &= \\alpha\\mathbf{I} + \\beta \\boldsymbol\\Phi^T \\boldsymbol\\Phi  \\tag{10}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n$(9)$ is the mean vector of the posterior and $(10)$ the inverse covariance matrix (= precision matrix). Hence, the posterior distribution can be written as\n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{m}_N, \\mathbf{S}_N) \\tag{11}\n$$\n\nFor the moment, we assume that the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are known. Since the posterior is proportional to the product of likelihood and prior, the log of the posterior distribution is proportional to the sum of the log likelihood and the log of the prior\n\n$$\n\\log p(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \n-\\beta E_D(\\mathbf{w}) - \\alpha E_W(\\mathbf{w}) + \\mathrm{const.} \\tag{12}\n$$\n\nwhere $E_D(\\mathbf{w})$ is defined by $(6)$ and \n\n$$\nE_W(\\mathbf{w}) = {1 \\over 2} \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w} \\tag{13}\n$$\n\nMaximizing the log posterior w.r.t. $\\mathbf{w}$ gives the [maximum-a-posteriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation) (MAP) estimate of $\\mathbf{w}$. Maximizing the log posterior is equivalent to minimizing the sum-of-squares error function $E_D$ plus a quadratic regularization term $E_W$. This particular form regularization is known as *L2 regularization* or *weight decay* as it limits the magnitude of weights $w_j$. The contribution of the regularization term is determined by the ratio $\\alpha / \\beta$.\n\n#### **<span style='color:#FF5733'>Posterior predictive distribution</span>**\n\nFor making a prediction $t$ at a new location $\\mathbf{x}$ we use the posterior predictive distribution which is defined as\n\n$$\np(t \\lvert \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \n\\int{p(t \\lvert \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta) p(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta) d\\mathbf{w}} \\tag{14}\n$$\n\nThe posterior predictive distribution includes uncertainty about parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ into predictions by weighting the conditional distribution $p(t \\lvert \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}, \\beta)$ with the posterior probability of weights $p(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta)$ over the entire weight parameter space. By using the predictive distribution we're not only getting the expected value of $t$ at a new location $\\mathbf{x}$ but also the uncertainty for that prediction. In our special case, the posterior predictive distribution is a Gaussian distribution\n\n$$\np(t \\lvert \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \n\\mathcal{N}(t \\lvert \\mathbf{m}_N^T \\boldsymbol\\phi(\\mathbf{x}), \\sigma_N^2(\\mathbf{x})) \\tag{15}\n$$\n<br>\n\nwhere mean $\\mathbf{m}_N^T \\boldsymbol\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ is the regression function after $N$ observations and $\\sigma_N^2(\\mathbf{x})$ is the corresponding predictive variance\n\n$$\n\\sigma_N^2(\\mathbf{x}) = {1 \\over \\beta} + \\boldsymbol\\phi(\\mathbf{x})^T \\mathbf{S}_N \\boldsymbol\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) \\tag{16}\n$$\n\nThe first term in $(16)$ represents the inherent noise in the data and the second term covers the uncertainty about parameters $\\mathbf{w}$. So far, we have assumed that the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are known. In a fully Bayesian treatment, however, we should define priors over $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and use the corresponding posteriors to additionally include uncertainties about $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ into predictions. Unfortunately, complete integration over all three parameters $\\mathbf{w}$, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is analytically intractable and we have to use another approach.\n\n#### **<span style='color:#FF5733'>Evidence Function</span>**\n\nEstimates for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can alternatively be obtained by first integrating the product of likelihood and prior over parameters $\\mathbf{w}$\n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{t} \\lvert \\alpha, \\beta) =\n\\int{p(\\mathbf{t} \\lvert \\mathbf{w}, \\beta) p(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\alpha) d\\mathbf{w}} \\tag{17}\n$$\n<br>\n\nand then maximizing the resulting *marginal likelihood* or *evidence function* w.r.t. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. This approach is known as [empirical Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method). It can be shown that this is a good approximation for a fully Bayesian treatment if the posterior for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is sharply peaked around the most probable value and the prior is relatively flat which is often a reasonable assumption. Integrating over model parameters or using a good approximation for it allows us to estimate values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, and hence the regularization strength $\\alpha / \\beta$, from training data alone i.e. without using a validation set. \n\nThe log of the marginal likelihood is given by\n\n$$\n\\log p(\\mathbf{t} \\lvert \\alpha, \\beta) = {M \\over 2} \\log \\alpha + {N \\over 2} \\log \\beta -\nE(\\mathbf{m}_N) - {1 \\over 2} \\log \\lvert \\mathbf{S}_N^{-1}\\rvert - {N \\over 2} \\log {2 \\pi} \\tag{18}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{m}_N) = {\\beta \\over 2} \\lVert \\mathbf{t} - \\boldsymbol\\Phi \\mathbf{m}_N \\rVert^2 +\n{\\alpha \\over 2} \\mathbf{m}_N^T \\mathbf{m}_N \\tag{19}\n$$\n<br>\n\nFor completeness, the relationship between evidence, likelihood, prior, posterior is of course given by Bayes' theorem\n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\mathbf{t}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \n{p(\\mathbf{t} \\lvert \\mathbf{w}, \\beta) p(\\mathbf{w} \\lvert \\alpha) \\over p(\\mathbf{t} \\lvert \\alpha, \\beta)}  \\tag{20}\n$$\n\n#### Maximization\n\nMaximization of the log marginal likelihood w.r.t. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ gives the following implicit solutions.\n\n$$\n\\alpha = {\\gamma \\over \\mathbf{m}_N^T \\mathbf{m}_N} \\tag{21}\n$$\n\nand \n\n$$\n{1 \\over \\beta} = {1 \\over N - \\gamma} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(t_i - \\mathbf{m}_N^T \\boldsymbol\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i))^2 \\tag{22}\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n$$\n\\gamma = \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} {\\lambda_i \\over \\alpha + \\lambda_i} \\tag{23}\n$$\n\n\nand $\\lambda_i$ are the [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of $\\beta \\boldsymbol\\Phi^T \\boldsymbol\\Phi$. The solutions are implicit because $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ as well as $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ depend on each other. Solutions for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can therefore be obtained by starting with initial values for these parameters and then iterating over the above equations until convergence.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div style=\"padding: 30px;color:white;margin:10;font-size:60%;text-align:left;display:fill;border-radius:10px;background-color:#FFFFFF;overflow:hidden;background-color:#FF5733\"><b><span style='color:#FFFFFF'>7 |</span></b> <b>ML MODELS TO PREDICT MEDIAN HOUSE VALUE</b></div>\n\n### <b><span style='color:#FF5733'> 7.1 |</span> Baseline bayesian regression models</b>\n\nFor the base models, let's investigate three things using a <b>5-fold Cross Validation</b> Approach:\n\n- Foremost, let's create a simple baseline model, `DummyRegressor()`\n- We have two ready dataframes, the original feature dataframe `trdata` & `tradata_upd`, with the additional two features.
